intended to improve the user experience and make using legal services

advantages like consultation discounts, loyalty points for recurring
appointments, and referral bonuses for referring friends to our platform.
In our opinion, these incentives not only increase access to legal services
but also give our users the power to manage their legal requirements in a
practical and enjoyable manner. The following are the several incentives
we offer

Currently, obtaining legal services and identifying suitable advocates is a COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING process.
